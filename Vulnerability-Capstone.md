# Vulnerability Capstone

## Objective

The goal of this project was to find vulnerabilities to exploit a website. This project highlights the process of discovering, analyzing, and successfully executing the exploit while documenting mistakes, thought processes, and lessons learned.

### Skills Learned

 - Application vulnerability detection and exploitation.
 - Analyzing exploit scripts and troubleshooting execution issues.
 - Setting up reverse shells for post-exploitation.
 - Leveraging exploit-db resources and understanding CVE structures.

### Tools Used

  - Exploit-DB: To locate relevant exploits.
  - Python: For script analysis and adjustments.
  - Netcat: For setting up the listener and reverse shell.
 
## Steps

1. Identify the Application and Version

    - After accessing the machine IP:

       - The vulnerable application was Fuel CMS.
       - Detected version: v1.4.

2. Research for Vulnerabilities

    - Using Exploit-DB, I researched known vulnerabilities for Fuel CMS:

       - Discovered CVE-2018-16763, which affects pre-v1.4.1 versions.
       - This CVE allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Linux systems.

3.  Analyze the Exploit
    I reviewed multiple exploits available for this CVE:

     - Exploit 1: Ineffective (poor code structure and formatting issues).
     - Exploit 2: Not a Python file and incompatible with the target machine.
     - Exploit 3: Promising! Required slight modifications.

4.  Execute the Exploit
      - Step 1: Start a Netcat listener on
      - Step 2: Run the exploit to trigger the reverse shell.

5.  Post-Exploitation
      - After successfully gaining access, capture the flag.
